Temperature Conversion Program.

A versatile Python program that simplifies temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales. This program allows users to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement, and it automatically converts the temperature to the other two units, providing the converted values as outputs.


Features:
i. Temperature Conversion: Effortlessly convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units.

ii. User-Friendly Interface: User input is facilitated through a straightforward and easy-to-use interface.

iii. Real-time Conversion: Instantly view converted temperatures without manual calculations.


Usage:
Launch the program, and you'll be prompted to input the temperature value and the original unit of measurement (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

The program will then display the temperature converted to the other two units in real-time.

For example, if you input a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, the program will convert it to Fahrenheit and Kelvin, and present the converted values as outputs.


Supported Units:
The program supports conversions between the following temperature units-
Celsius (°C)
Fahrenheit (°F)
Kelvin (K)
